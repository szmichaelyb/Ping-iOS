Hi Rishabh,

I work with Nam over here on the Giphy team. Thanks for sending everything for your page! It's up now here: http://giphy.com/gocandid/

And we've also set you up with a login so you can upload/tag GIFs to your page. Login info here:

login URL: giphy.com/login
login email: rtayal11+gocandid@gmail.com
PW: gocandidlovesgiphy

Once you're logged in you'll see your partner name in the top right corner. From there you can hit the upload button to add GIFs to your page or scroll over your partner name and go into your settings to update your banner, avatar, and other page assets. 

Also here's a link with some info on the ways to use Giphy: http://giphy.com/how-to-giphy/

If you have questions about anything, just let us know. Have a great weekend!

Best,
Rebekah
